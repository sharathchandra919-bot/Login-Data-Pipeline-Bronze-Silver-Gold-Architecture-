Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline built using Apache Spark, following the Bronze–Silver–Gold data architecture pattern.

The pipeline processes raw social media usage data, cleans and deduplicates it, applies data quality checks, and produces business-ready analytical metrics such as engagement vs satisfaction.
